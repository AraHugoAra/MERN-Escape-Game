# ðŸªœMERN-Escape-Game

In this project, you will implement a booking platform for escape game. What is an escape game ? [See this](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeu_d%27%C3%A9vasion)

The client give you the technical documentation and a list of tickets below.

Your team have only 7 days so the client's request is too ambitious, so you will have to use agility to do the maximum without wasting time.
We strongly recommend the use of a kanban.

You will push on your Git repository:

    - the code
    - a screenshot of your kanban
    - your unit tests 

## Features 

    - all the features are listed in the technical documentation ([see here](https://github.com/Matrice-io/MERN-Escape-Game/blob/main/Document_technique.png))
  
## BONUS (advanced features)

    - Add a checkbox on the booking page, to automatically fill in the info of the logged in user
    - A user should be able to cancel an upcoming booking on the page that sums up their bookings
    - On the homepage, display all existing rooms as a list of cards instead of displaying them in a table. The list must be responsive.

    - Add the possibility for a different group to book the same slot if there are spots left in a room after a booking. The first user to book the slot will have to check an option to specify that they accept new players to fill the remaining seats in their slot.
    - When the number of players in modified in the booking page, any supplied information disappears. We want to be able to keep filled in fields.
    - Add a page only available to admin users, where the admin can modify the details of existing rooms
