# MERN-Escape-Game

You will integrate a booking platform for escape game.
The client give you the technical documentation and this list of tickets.

You will push on your Git repository:

    - the updated documentation (any change you make to the codebase must be reflected in the documentation)
    - the code
    - your unit tests


## Features

    - Add a checkbox on the booking page, to automatically fill in the info of the logged in user
    - A user should be able to cancel an upcoming booking on the page that sums up their bookings
    - On the homepage, display all existing rooms as a list of cards instead of displaying them in a table. The list must be responsive.

## BONUS (advanced features)

    - Add the possibility for a different group to book the same slot if there are spots left in a room after a booking. The first user to book the slot will have to check an option to specify that they accept new players to fill the remaining seats in their slot.
    - When the number of players in modified in the booking page, any supplied information disappears. We want to be able to keep filled in fields.
    - Add a page only available to admin users, where the admin can modify the details of existing rooms
